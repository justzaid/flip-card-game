## Description

The Card Memory game is a type of *concentration game* that challenges players to find matching pairs that are randomly distributed across a 4 x 4 grid. 

This game was chosen for the project as it challenges players to remember the position of the last two cards they revealed. This is coupled with the timer that starts ticking when the first card is clicked. This interesting challenge pushes players to beat the game using mental power.

This game also has the potential to expand and scale its difficulty by creating similar icons/images to test a player's memory or by creating larger grids.

## Technologies Used

**JavaScript** was the mastermind behind the functionality of this game and what the user sees on the front-end. Using JavaScript provided the ability to create a seamless experience from clicking to comparing cards and what they do in each interaction. Manipulating elements using DOM techniques allowed to switch between what actions every element undertakes written in hard-coded HTML and CSS.

**HTML** was used to create the structure of the project by using a number Div elements to section content across the page and providing them with unique ID's that behave individually and independently from neighbouring elements. Having a unified class, however, provided the opportunity to cache elements for specific use with JavaScript.

**CSS** created the professional look and feel of the webpage by using intermediate techniques such as positioning with flexbox, applying colored elements (when assigning classes with classList), and designing with Bootstrap, and Google Fonts. 

## Next steps

Future enhancements will include creating more levels with different themes to add variety.

A few options could be using categories relating to 

+ Landscapes
+ Food
+ Country flags, etc.

> Another interesting feature could also include creating a seperate difficulty system that increases the amount of cards inside the grid to 6 x 6, 8 x 8, etc.
